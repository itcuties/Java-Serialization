Java-Serialization
==================

Today we are going to talk about Java serialization. Serialization process is used to convert Java objects into their binary representation which can be easily stored on the drive or send via network to another Java program running on different JVM. The reverse process, converting from binary representation to Java objects is called deserialization. This is a tutorial material. Feel free to use it any way you want.
